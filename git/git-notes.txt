	a place where we can store things

what is a git?
	- version control system (VCS) and collaboration tol

Centralized vs Distributed VCS
	- Centralized VCS uses a central location to store all of the source code, data and records
		- there are many issues with this...
			- What if we lose internet?
			- What if the remote centralized location goes down?
	- Distributed VCS creates a COPY of the source code on each user's machine
		- if you lose internet, you can still work on the code locally

Common git commands:
	git init: creates a new git repo locally
	git add [filename]: adds file to staging
		- git add . : adds all files from the current directory
		- git add -a: adds all changes from any file in to the repository to staging
	git commit -m "(message notes)": adds all changes that are in staging to an official commit
	git push: send latest commits from local repo to remote repository
	git pull: get latest commits from remote repo to local repository
	git log: displays all commits made
	git status: display whats in staging
	git clone [GITHUB URL]: get remote repo to local machine for the first time
